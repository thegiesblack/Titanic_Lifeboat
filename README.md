Welcome aboard! To the unsinkable ship, Titanic 2.0!

Please take a seat while the captain and his crews are planning to arrange each one of you to the lifeboat.

Seriously?

Well, it's just, you know, in case of something bad happen, we know what to do.

First, we are going to sort all of you from the youngest to the oldest, both the passengers and the crews.

Second, for the top 8, congratulations! You are chosen to ride our next gen ship, a lifeboat.
